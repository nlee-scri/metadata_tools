       "  'abtract': 'Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health threat. Understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions within TB granulomas will assist in identifying what leads to the successful elimination of infection. In vitro TB models provide a controllable environment to study these granuloma dynamics. Previously we developed a biomimetic 3D spheroid granuloma model that controls bacteria better than a traditional monolayer culture counterpart. We used agent-based simulations to predict the mechanistic reason for this difference. Our calibrated simulations were able to predict heterogeneous bacterial dynamics that are consistent with experimental data. In one group of simulations, spheroids are found to have higher macrophage activation than their traditional counterparts, leading to better bacterial control. This higher macrophage activation in the spheroids was not due to higher counts of activated T cells, instead fewer activated T cells were able to activate more macrophages due to the proximity of these cells to each other within the spheroid. In a second group of simulations, spheroids again have more macrophage activation but also more T cell activation, specifically CD8+ T cells. This higher level of CD8+ T cell activation is predicted to be due to the proximity of these cells to the cells that activate them. Multiple mechanisms of control were predicted. Simulations removing individual mechanisms show that one group of simulations has a CD4+ T cell dominant response, while the other has a mixed/CD8+ T cell dominant response. Lastly, we demonstrated that in spheroids the initial structure and movement rules work synergistically to reduce bacterial load. These findings provide valuable insights into how the structural complexity of in vitro models impacts immune responses. Moreover, our study has implications for engineering more physiologically relevant in vitro models and advancing our understanding of TB pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.',\n",

We find the reduced response to low-dose LPS correlates with minimal TLR4 and CD14 surface expression, despite sufficient internal expression of TLR4. Additionally, we find that AMs do not produce IL-10 in response to a variety of PAMPs due to low expression of transcription factor c-Maf and that lack of IL-10 production contributes to an enhancement of pro-inflammatory responses by Type I IFN. Our findings demonstrate that AMs have cell-intrinsic dampened responses to LPS, which is enhanced by type I IFN exposure.

While alveolitis has been associated with prior immunity in human post-mortem studies, the drivers of these distinct pathologic outcomes are poorly understood. Here, we show that these divergent lesion structures can be modeled in C3HeB/FeJ mice and are regulated by prior immunity. Using quantitative imaging, scRNAseq, and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Mtb infection in the absence of prior immunity elicits dysregulated neutrophil recruitment and necrotic granulomas. In contrast, prior immunity induces rapid recruitment and activation of T cells, local macrophage activation, and diminished late neutrophil responses. Depletion studies at distinct infection stages demonstrated that neutrophils are required for early necrosis initiation and necrosis propagation at chronic stages, whereas early CD4 T cell responses prevent neutrophil feedforward circuits and necrosis. Together, these studies reveal fundamental determinants of tuberculosis lesion structure and pathogenesis, which have important implications for new strategies to prevent or treat tuberculosis.'},\n",

       "  'abtract': 'Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a critical role during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection as the first cells in the lung to encounter bacteria. We previously showed that AMs initially respond to Mtb in vivo by mounting a cell-protective, rather than pro-inflammatory response. However, the plasticity of the initial AM response was unknown. Here, we characterize how previous exposure to Mycobacterium, either through subcutaneous vaccination with Mycobacterium bovis (scBCG) or through a contained Mtb infection (coMtb) that mimics aspects of concomitant immunity, impacts the initial response by AMs. We find that both scBCG and coMtb accelerate early innate cell activation and recruitment and generate a stronger pro-inflammatory response to Mtb in vivo by AMs. Within the lung environment, AMs from scBCG vaccinated mice mount a robust interferon-associated response, while AMs from coMtb mice produce a broader inflammatory response that is not dominated by Interferon Stimulated Genes. Using scRNAseq, we identify changes to the frequency and phenotype of airway-resident macrophages following Mycobacterium exposure, with enrichment for both interferon-associated and pro-inflammatory populations of AMs. In contrast, minimal changes were found for airway-resident T cells and dendritic cells after exposures. Ex vivo stimulation of AMs with Pam3Cys, LPS and Mtb reveal that scBCG and coMtb exposures generate stronger interferon-associated responses to LPS and Mtb that are cell-intrinsic changes. However, AM profiles that were unique to each exposure modality following Mtb infection in vivo are dependent on the lung environment and do not emerge following ex vivo stimulation. Overall, our studies reveal significant and durable remodeling of AMs following exposure to Mycobacterium, with evidence for both AM-intrinsic changes and contributions from the altered lung microenvironments. Comparisons between the scBCG and coMtb models highlight the plasticity of AMs in the airway and opportunities to target their function through vaccination or host-directed therapies.',\n",

In an HIV-endemic area in rural South Africa, we used a CAD algorithm (CAD4TBv5) to interpret digital chest x-rays (CXR) as part of a mobile health screening effort. Participants with TB symptoms or CAD4TBv5 score above the triaging threshold were referred for microbiological sputum assessment. During an initial pilot phase, a low CAD4TBv5 triaging threshold of 25 was selected to maximize TB case finding. We report the performance of CAD4TBv5 in screening 9,914 participants, 99 (1.0%) of whom were found to have microbiologically proven TB. CAD4TBv5 was able to identify TB cases at the same sensitivity but lower specificity as a blinded radiologist, whereas the next generation of the algorithm (CAD4TBv6) achieved comparable sensitivity and specificity to the radiologist. The CXRs of people with microbiologically confirmed TB spanned a range of lung field abnormality, including 19 (19.2%) cases deemed normal by the radiologist. HIV serostatus did not impact CAD4TB's performance. Notably, 78.8% of the TB cases identified during this population-based survey were asymptomatic and therefore triaged for sputum collection on the basis of CAD4TBv5 score alone. While CAD4TBv6 has the potential to replace radiologists for triaging CXRs in TB prevalence surveys, population-specific piloting is necessary to set the appropriate triaging thresholds. Further work on image analysis strategies is needed to identify radiologically subtle active TB.\",\n",

In this study, we characterize the metabolic and transcriptional responses of murine macrophages to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in order to disentangle the underlying mechanisms. We find that type I interferon (IFN) signaling correlates with the decreased glycolysis and mitochondrial damage that is induced by live, but not killed, Mtb. Macrophages lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) maintain glycolytic flux and mitochondrial function during Mtb infection in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo. IFNβ itself restrains the glycolytic shift of inflammatory macrophages and initiates mitochondrial stress. We confirm that type I IFN acts upstream of mitochondrial damage using macrophages lacking the protein STING. We suggest that a type I IFN-mitochondrial feedback loop controls macrophage responses to mycobacteria and that this could contribute to pathogenesis across a range of diseases.',\n",

IFNɣ produced by CD4 T\\xa0cells is a key cytokine that contributes to protection. However, lung-infiltrating CD4 T\\xa0cells have a limited ability to produce IFNɣ, and IFNɣ plays a lesser protective role within the lung than at sites of Mtb dissemination. In a murine infection model, we observed that IFNɣ production by Mtb-specific CD4 T\\xa0cells is rapidly extinguished within the granuloma but not within unaffected lung regions, suggesting localized immunosuppression. We identified a signature of TGFβ signaling within granuloma-infiltrating T\\xa0cells in both mice and rhesus macaques. Selective blockade of TGFβ signaling in T\\xa0cells resulted in an accumulation of terminally differentiated effector CD4 T\\xa0cells, improved IFNɣ production within granulomas, and reduced bacterial burdens.

The proposed algorithm targets the distribution of a class of random convex polytopes which encapsulate the DS inference. The sampler relies on an equivalence between the iterative constraints of the vertex configuration and the non-negativity of cycles in a fully connected directed graph.

Unlike human TB, murine infection results in uniformly high lung bacterial burdens and poorly organized granulomas. To develop a TB model that more closely resembles human disease, we infected mice with an ultra-low dose (ULD) of between 1-3 founding bacteria, reflecting a physiologic inoculum. ULD-infected mice exhibited highly heterogeneous bacterial burdens, well-circumscribed granulomas that shared features with human granulomas, and prolonged Mtb containment with unilateral pulmonary infection in some mice. We identified blood RNA signatures in mice infected with an ULD or a conventional Mtb dose (50-100 CFU) that correlated with lung bacterial burdens and predicted Mtb infection outcomes across species, including risk of progression to active TB in humans. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of the murine TB model and show that ULD infection recapitulates key features of human TB.',\n",

       "  'abtract': 'Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health threat. Understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions within TB granulomas will assist in identifying what leads to the successful elimination of infection. In vitro TB models provide a controllable environment to study these granuloma dynamics. Previously we developed a biomimetic 3D spheroid granuloma model that controls bacteria better than a traditional monolayer culture counterpart. We used agent-based simulations to predict the mechanistic reason for this difference. Our calibrated simulations were able to predict heterogeneous bacterial dynamics that are consistent with experimental data. In one group of simulations, spheroids are found to have higher macrophage activation than their traditional counterparts, leading to better bacterial control. This higher macrophage activation in the spheroids was not due to higher counts of activated T cells, instead fewer activated T cells were able to activate more macrophages due to the proximity of these cells to each other within the spheroid. In a second group of simulations, spheroids again have more macrophage activation but also more T cell activation, specifically CD8+ T cells. This higher level of CD8+ T cell activation is predicted to be due to the proximity of these cells to the cells that activate them. Multiple mechanisms of control were predicted. Simulations removing individual mechanisms show that one group of simulations has a CD4+ T cell dominant response, while the other has a mixed/CD8+ T cell dominant response. Lastly, we demonstrated that in spheroids the initial structure and movement rules work synergistically to reduce bacterial load. These findings provide valuable insights into how the structural complexity of in vitro models impacts immune responses. Moreover, our study has implications for engineering more physiologically relevant in vitro models and advancing our understanding of TB pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.',\n",

We find the reduced response to low-dose LPS correlates with minimal TLR4 and CD14 surface expression, despite sufficient internal expression of TLR4. Additionally, we find that AMs do not produce IL-10 in response to a variety of PAMPs due to low expression of transcription factor c-Maf and that lack of IL-10 production contributes to an enhancement of pro-inflammatory responses by Type I IFN. Our findings demonstrate that AMs have cell-intrinsic dampened responses to LPS, which is enhanced by type I IFN exposure.

While alveolitis has been associated with prior immunity in human post-mortem studies, the drivers of these distinct pathologic outcomes are poorly understood. Here, we show that these divergent lesion structures can be modeled in C3HeB/FeJ mice and are regulated by prior immunity. Using quantitative imaging, scRNAseq, and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Mtb infection in the absence of prior immunity elicits dysregulated neutrophil recruitment and necrotic granulomas. In contrast, prior immunity induces rapid recruitment and activation of T cells, local macrophage activation, and diminished late neutrophil responses. Depletion studies at distinct infection stages demonstrated that neutrophils are required for early necrosis initiation and necrosis propagation at chronic stages, whereas early CD4 T cell responses prevent neutrophil feedforward circuits and necrosis. Together, these studies reveal fundamental determinants of tuberculosis lesion structure and pathogenesis, which have important implications for new strategies to prevent or treat tuberculosis.'},\n",

       "  'abtract': 'Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a critical role during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection as the first cells in the lung to encounter bacteria. We previously showed that AMs initially respond to Mtb in vivo by mounting a cell-protective, rather than pro-inflammatory response. However, the plasticity of the initial AM response was unknown. Here, we characterize how previous exposure to Mycobacterium, either through subcutaneous vaccination with Mycobacterium bovis (scBCG) or through a contained Mtb infection (coMtb) that mimics aspects of concomitant immunity, impacts the initial response by AMs. We find that both scBCG and coMtb accelerate early innate cell activation and recruitment and generate a stronger pro-inflammatory response to Mtb in vivo by AMs. Within the lung environment, AMs from scBCG vaccinated mice mount a robust interferon-associated response, while AMs from coMtb mice produce a broader inflammatory response that is not dominated by Interferon Stimulated Genes. Using scRNAseq, we identify changes to the frequency and phenotype of airway-resident macrophages following Mycobacterium exposure, with enrichment for both interferon-associated and pro-inflammatory populations of AMs. In contrast, minimal changes were found for airway-resident T cells and dendritic cells after exposures. Ex vivo stimulation of AMs with Pam3Cys, LPS and Mtb reveal that scBCG and coMtb exposures generate stronger interferon-associated responses to LPS and Mtb that are cell-intrinsic changes. However, AM profiles that were unique to each exposure modality following Mtb infection in vivo are dependent on the lung environment and do not emerge following ex vivo stimulation. Overall, our studies reveal significant and durable remodeling of AMs following exposure to Mycobacterium, with evidence for both AM-intrinsic changes and contributions from the altered lung microenvironments. Comparisons between the scBCG and coMtb models highlight the plasticity of AMs in the airway and opportunities to target their function through vaccination or host-directed therapies.',\n",

       "  'abtract': \"Computer-aided digital chest radiograph interpretation (CAD) can facilitate high-throughput screening for tuberculosis (TB), but its use in population-based active case-finding programs has been limited. In an HIV-endemic area in rural South Africa, we used a CAD algorithm (CAD4TBv5) to interpret digital chest x-rays (CXR) as part of a mobile health screening effort. Participants with TB symptoms or CAD4TBv5 score above the triaging threshold were referred for microbiological sputum assessment. During an initial pilot phase, a low CAD4TBv5 triaging threshold of 25 was selected to maximize TB case finding. We report the performance of CAD4TBv5 in screening 9,914 participants, 99 (1.0%) of whom were found to have microbiologically proven TB. CAD4TBv5 was able to identify TB cases at the same sensitivity but lower specificity as a blinded radiologist, whereas the next generation of the algorithm (CAD4TBv6) achieved comparable sensitivity and specificity to the radiologist. The CXRs of people with microbiologically confirmed TB spanned a range of lung field abnormality, including 19 (19.2%) cases deemed normal by the radiologist. HIV serostatus did not impact CAD4TB's performance. Notably, 78.8% of the TB cases identified during this population-based survey were asymptomatic and therefore triaged for sputum collection on the basis of CAD4TBv5 score alone. While CAD4TBv6 has the potential to replace radiologists for triaging CXRs in TB prevalence surveys, population-specific piloting is necessary to set the appropriate triaging thresholds. Further work on image analysis strategies is needed to identify radiologically subtle active TB.\",\n",

In this study, we characterize the metabolic and transcriptional responses of murine macrophages to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in order to disentangle the underlying mechanisms. We find that type I interferon (IFN) signaling correlates with the decreased glycolysis and mitochondrial damage that is induced by live, but not killed, Mtb. Macrophages lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) maintain glycolytic flux and mitochondrial function during Mtb infection in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo. IFNβ itself restrains the glycolytic shift of inflammatory macrophages and initiates mitochondrial stress. We confirm that type I IFN acts upstream of mitochondrial damage using macrophages lacking the protein STING. We suggest that a type I IFN-mitochondrial feedback loop controls macrophage responses to mycobacteria and that this could contribute to pathogenesis across a range of diseases.',\n",

IFNɣ produced by CD4 T\\xa0cells is a key cytokine that contributes to protection. However, lung-infiltrating CD4 T\\xa0cells have a limited ability to produce IFNɣ, and IFNɣ plays a lesser protective role within the lung than at sites of Mtb dissemination. In a murine infection model, we observed that IFNɣ production by Mtb-specific CD4 T\\xa0cells is rapidly extinguished within the granuloma but not within unaffected lung regions, suggesting localized immunosuppression. We identified a signature of TGFβ signaling within granuloma-infiltrating T\\xa0cells in both mice and rhesus macaques. Selective blockade of TGFβ signaling in T\\xa0cells resulted in an accumulation of terminally differentiated effector CD4 T\\xa0cells, improved IFNɣ production within granulomas, and reduced bacterial burdens. These findings uncover a spatially localized immunosuppressive mechanism associated with Mtb infection and provide potential targets for host-directed therapy.',\n",

The proposed algorithm targets the distribution of a class of random convex polytopes which encapsulate the DS inference. The sampler relies on an equivalence between the iterative constraints of the vertex configuration and the non-negativity of cycles in a fully connected directed graph.

Unlike human TB, murine infection results in uniformly high lung bacterial burdens and poorly organized granulomas. To develop a TB model that more closely resembles human disease, we infected mice with an ultra-low dose (ULD) of between 1-3 founding bacteria, reflecting a physiologic inoculum. ULD-infected mice exhibited highly heterogeneous bacterial burdens, well-circumscribed granulomas that shared features with human granulomas, and prolonged Mtb containment with unilateral pulmonary infection in some mice. We identified blood RNA signatures in mice infected with an ULD or a conventional Mtb dose (50-100 CFU) that correlated with lung bacterial burdens and predicted Mtb infection outcomes across species, including risk of progression to active TB in humans. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of the murine TB model and show that ULD infection recapitulates key features of human TB.',\n",
